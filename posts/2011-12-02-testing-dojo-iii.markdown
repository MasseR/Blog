Today was the third dojo. Unlike the last time when we relaxed the rules and
the rest of the group was also actively advising the driver and co-pilot, this
time the rules were enforced. The subject this time however was extremely
interesting and close to my heart. This in turn helped to keep me active in my
own way, keeping an eye of what they're doing and taking notes. I was last to
go and thanks to that I was able to get a couple of ideas that I could do. I
believe we got to the heart of dojos this time.

The topic this time was exploratory testing, and at some level it's something
that every developer has done at some point when hunting down a bug.
Exploratory testing and the verbs associated to it are just a nice cover for "I
want to see how this works and break it". You have an idea what might go wrong
and you try to make it go wrong.

The task was presented to us as a challenge, to find bugs in our university web
site. It was worded something along the like "you will not find anything, as
there aren't any bugs". I don't know about the others, but it got me all riled
up, thinking of ways to break it.

I try to be mindful of the possible problems and security risks that are
involved in my web development job. I'm not the smartest man in the world but I
try to keep up with the risks involved and this challenge provided me means to
test my knowledge. I was expecting that the most touted security risks were
taken care of by now, but little did I know of the multitude of problems that
might exist elsewhere.
