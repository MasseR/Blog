Sometimes you have simple problems with simple solutions. I am an avid tea
drinker but I have trouble keeping tab on how long the tea has been steeping.
Clearly I need a timer of sorts. Yeah, I know, it's a problem solved millions
of times. For a long time I used Tea Timer on android, but I had some problems
with it. My main gripe with it is that it notifies the user by vibrating the
phone. The problem is that if it's in my pocket, I can't feel it. Also if I try
to use it with my tablet, it won't work because it doesn't vibrate. I tried the
default timer on the phone, but it notifies by sound and most of the time, it's
not appropriate to be loud, eg. at work or when my wife is sleeping.

My third solution was a simple shell script. Simple enough to show inline:
`sleep 120; notify-send "Tea"`. The problem with this was that it sat there
idly until the time runs out and sends out a notification. If I miss the
notification, I have no idea when the notification was. Also if I try to check
how much time is left, so that I can see whether the tea is soon or if I can
still focus on something else. As a solution, I wrote the following script in
one morning before my first cup of tea. It takes a time in seconds, counts down
to 0 and then notifies with `notify-send`.

~~~{.bash}
#!/bin/bash

start=$1
now=$(date +%s)

remaining=$(($start - ($(date +%s) - $now)))
while [ $remaining -gt 0 ]; do
    echo -ne "\r\033[K$remaining"
    sleep 1;
    remaining=$(($start - ($(date +%s) - $now)))
done

notify-send "Tea" "Tea"
~~~
