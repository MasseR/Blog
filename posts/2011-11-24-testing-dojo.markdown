Turku university is having a software testing course (ohjelmistotestaus) for
computer science students. This year the course is held by two employees of
Lindorff Oy, and as far as I understood this is the first time the course is
held like this. Their plan was to have two lectures, and four
[dojos](http://codingdojo.org/). Aside for those, we are supposed to keep a
learning diary or a blog, do a lecture on a subject for our groups and write a
proper text from our subject. As you might have guessed, I chose my format to
be a blog post.
