Some thoughts on what I could write about

- Rsync and backuping. Take benchmarks with `--link-dest` into consideration?
- Wrote a little bit of quickcheck on introitu. Could elaborate on that?
- Finish the benchmarking post
- Finish the triemap post
- How about the naive bayes + images?
- How about writing about convolving and sobel operator (edge detection)?
