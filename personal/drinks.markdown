## Teas

I have always been a friend of tea. Ever since I was a child we have always had
an abundance of tea at home which I enjoyed drinking. However I have also been
a sucker for sweet things, so my tea flavour usually consisted of 1% tea and
99% honey or sugar.

For the last couple of years things have changed. I went to university and I
couldn't cope with my sleeping hours anymore so I took up coffee for its
caffeine. Again I used insane amounts of sugar, especially so because coffee
and honey, yuck. Then came this one time when I tasted extremely strong coffee
without any sugar or milk after which I just couldn't put any sugar in coffee
anymore. After I realized I didn't really never enjoy the taste of coffee, I
took up tea again, this time properly. We bought a simple tea set consisting of
a teapot and couple of steeping balls. Later we expanded it by bying a small
strainer, this way the tea can expand all it wants.

Depending on the day I can enjoy any flavour of teas. One day I might enjoy a
cup (or 5) of basic unflavoured black tea, and on the next highly flavoured
white tea. Just like anyone who has fallen to the temptation of loose leaf, my
cupboard contains many different teas ranging from black to white, flavoured to
unflavoured. Especially during cold winters I enjoy a nice cup of black tea
with a bit of honey, [to keep cold
away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_honey).

### Black teas
- [English Breakfast
  Tea](http://steepster.com/teas/twinings/490-english-breakfast). Black tea.
  The first time we bought this was when we were on vacation in Greece.
  Considering the steeping equipment we had there, the taste was great. Strong
  flavour When we came back to finland we bought loose leaf English Breakfast
  Tea from Twinings. This is one of the two teas I keep at work, but lately I
  haven't been able to get the flavour out of this. Maybe the leafs have
  suffered from air as they aren't preserved stored properly.
- Russian blend.
- Ruusutee.
- Hehkuva talvi.
- Earl grey

### White teas
- Valkoinen tiikeri (white tiger). Basic white tea from either Nordqvist or
  Forsman (we cannibalized the original packaging when we stored it in a tin
  can). I love it after learning how to steep white tea properly. Water
  temperature must be 85 degrees celcius or less, and steep for 2-3 minutes.
- Ginger pearls from [Turun tee ja
  mauste](http://steepster.com/companies/turun-tee-ja-mauste). I'm not too
  impressed with this ginger flavoured white tea. The ginger flavour is too
  strong masking all of the white tea flavour. It also leaves some sort of
  floury after taste and/or texture to your mouth. The tea leaves are
  interesting looking after steeping them, sort of tentacle like.

### Green teas
- Gun powder from [Turun tee ja
  mauste](http://steepster.com/companies/turun-tee-ja-mauste). Basic green tea
  that has been rolled up. I like this tea. It has a nice strong leafy flavour
  with a smoky side.
- Gun powder from Twinings. Haven't found this in a while, but if my memory
  serves me correctly, this too has a nice strong leafy flavour, but doesn't
  have the smoky side in it.
- [http://steepster.com/teas/forsman-tea/20052-vihrea-sitruuna-kamomilla-green-lemon-camomille](Vihre√§
  sitruuna-kamomilla) (green lemon-camomille) from Forsman Tea. This my goto
  tea at work. It doesn't get bitter easily, probably because of the
  flavourings, and can be steeped multiple times. The taste begins as a sour
  tea, moving to a mellower flavour after each steeping.

### Other
- Unknown pu-erh tea from [Turun tee ja
  mauste](http://steepster.com/companies/turun-tee-ja-mauste). It's not in the
  normal cake form but loose leaf. The thing with pu-erh is that it's flavour
  is so unlike anything else that it takes some time to get used to. The first
  time I drank it I wasn't sure at all that I would like it. Now I crave it. If
  you have pu-erh available with good price, definitely try it. Try drinking at
  least a couple of cups of it before dissing it. I usually boil the water and
  steep for 1 minute.
